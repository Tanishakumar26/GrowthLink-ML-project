Credit Card Fraud Detection System
# Fraud Detection System

## üìã Project Objective
The goal is to build a machine learning model that detects fraudulent transactions based on transaction attributes like amount, merchant information, user details, and timestamps.

The system focuses on:
- **Maximizing fraud detection accuracy**.
- **Minimizing false positives** (legitimate transactions wrongly flagged as fraud).
- **Providing explanations for model misclassifications**.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run This Project

1. **Clone this repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/fraud_detection_project.git
    cd fraud_detection_project
    ```

2. **Install required libraries**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Place your dataset**  
   - Add `fraudTrain.csv` and `fraudTest.csv` inside the `data/` folder.

4. **Run the project**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The outputs (metrics, feature importance plots, confusion matrix) will be printed and visualized automatically.
